# blockvista - Procedural 3D Block Art

[blockvista live](https://peterhancock.github.io/blockvista/)

This is a procedural generative art project that creates animated 3D isometric block structures using TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. The application generates infinite, fractal-like patterns of colored blocks based on deterministic random seeds

The designs are not my own, but a reverse-engineer of the work of the Generative Artist [Kjetil Golid](https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/10/11/interview-with-generative-artist-kjetil-golid)
